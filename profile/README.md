## ðŸ“š Abstract

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial sector by offering lending, borrowing, trading, and other financial services without traditional intermediaries. 
However, many novice users face challenges when trying to enter the DeFi ecosystem due to security concerns, technical complexity, and lack of accessibility. 
With this project we aim to address these issues by providing a user-friendly and secure solution for novice users looking to explore the world of decentralized finance.
