### 1. Executive Summary

  

Discovery Account is an ambitious project to provide a user-friendly and secure solution to initiate their first DeFi transactions. The account will be built using account abstraction (eip-4337), offering enhanced security, and an optimal user experience.

  

By integrating our solution into the Ethereum and Optimism ecosystems, we offer users access to Aave for DeFi lending and borrowing, as well as the opportunity to leverage Optimism's scaling solution. The Discovery account strives to enhance the accessibility of DeFi and facilitate the onboarding of new users into blockchain ecosystems by mitigating the risk of fund loss caused by scams or mishandling.

  

### 2. Introduction

  

Blockchain ecosystems are complex to understand for users who discover them. Thus, losing their tokens following a manipulation error or a scam is commonplace and in the majority of cases, sells out by the end of the blockchain adventure for new users.

  

It is to combat these problems that the Discovery Account was created. It makes it possible to verify with each transaction issued by a user that it does not compromise either the security of the funds or the integrity of the wallet while adding a system for recovering the funds in the event of loss of the private key.

  
  

### 3. Objectives

  

The key objectives of our project are as follows:

  

- Provide secure way to manage an account for new users

  

- Provide easy access to the most popular lending platforms such as Aave to safely engage users with DeFi thanks to user-configured guardrails.

  

- Utilize Optimism's scaling solution to enhance scalability and transaction throughput.

  

- Enhance security measures for users using account abstraction.

  

- Offer a user-friendly interface and an optimal user experience to facilitate user onboarding

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

### 4. Architecture and Features

  

#### 4.1 Technical choices :

  

To develop our solution, we have chosen to use trampoline.

#### 4.2 Integration of Optimism's

  

We have chosen to integrate Optimism, this will enable faster and more cost-effective transactions than the L1 network, improving the overall user experience.

  

Moreover, it was a great opportunity for us to bring this project which we believe will have a positive impact on the community. Onboarding in DeFi with safenets can be useful for many.

The already existing community could also help us troubleshoot and build a better experience for users thus contributing to the ecosystem.

  

From a technical perspective, it was very easy for us to deploy our smart contracts on Optimism without rewriting them which allowed us to focus on enhancing our application rather than adapting our code.

  

#### 4.3 Enhanced Security

  

DeFi and EOA can be challenging for inexperienced users, but account abstraction offers a solution. It provides a service that allows users to establish safeguards for the security of their funds. The goal is not to limit users, as they can still access their funds whenever they want, but to assist them in avoiding potential issues.

Our offers the following benefits:

-   Seamless interaction with DeFi whitelist protocols like AAVE and UNISWAP, which have demonstrated their resilience.
    
-   Authorization of transfers exclusively to designated addresses. Easy recovery system in case of any unforeseen circumstances.
    
-   By utilizing account abstraction, we aim to empower users with a safer and more friendly experience in the world of DeFi and AEO.
    

  

#### 4.4 User-Friendly Interface and Optimal User Experience

  
  

Our account abstracted solution will feature a user-friendly interface designed to simplify the DeFi experience for novice users. We will prioritize intuitive navigation, seamless transaction execution, and real-time portfolio tracking to ensure an optimal user experience.

  

One of the main hurdles for new users could be the fear of being scammed or not knowing what to do. With our developed abstracted account solution, we get rid of those problems by only allowing community-trusted protocols such as AAVE to be used. By doing so, the beginner will be able to explore and learn with a risk-free experience.

  
  
  
  

### 5. Use Cases

  

Discovery Account is a multifunctional tool that can be used by organizations as well as by cautious users.

Managing your personal account or the funds of an organization by taking advantage of the assurance that you are interacting with the right smart contract or that the token exchanged is not a scam allows everyone to interact serenely with the blockchain.

  

Another possibility is the creation of Wallet Accounts supervised by parents and used by their teenagers. In this case, the Discovery Wallet will allow teenagers to have the equivalent of an account while limiting the associated risks as much as possible. What better way to discover the blockchain ecosystem?

  
  

### 6. Roadmap

  

Our roadmap will outline our project's key milestones and development stages, including wallet deployment, account abstraction, integration with Aave and Optimism, and future enhancements. The roadmap will be published separately and regularly updated to reflect progress.

  

### 7. Conclusion

  

Our Secure Wallet for DeFi Transactions aims to provide a secure and user-friendly solution for users to safely initiate their first DeFi transactions. By leveraging Ethereum as the base fund, integrating with Aave, and utilizing Optimism's scaling solution, we aim to make DeFi more accessible and secure for all users, driving the adoption of decentralized finance.
